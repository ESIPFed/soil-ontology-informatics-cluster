Here to observe, mostly.  
8. **Hava Blair**: PhD student at University of Minnesota, Land & Atmospheric Sciences program.  My research is in linking soil properties and processes with agricultural management practices (“soil health”).  We are curating and harmonizing regional soil health datasets as part of a soil health database project in partnership with agroinformatics platform [GEMS](https://agroinformatics.org/).  Starting to learn about the value of ontologies for linking data and eager to learn/help develop more soil-specific ontology terms.    
9. **Nic Jelinski:** Pedologist at University of Minnesota. I am a pedologist interested in harnessing big data for soil survey. My work is mostly centered in poorly characterized regions of Alaska and sub-Saharan Africa.   
10. **Avni Malhotra:** I am a postdoc at Stanford University and a coordinator for the International Soil Carbon Network. My research focuses on plant inputs to soil carbon and I am especially interested in organic soils.

Participate in EJP Soil project where we are compiling codelists for soil to aid soil data exchange, connecting systems for INSPIRE and want to use the same ones for GSP.  
19. **Gaurav Sinha:** GIScientist and Geographer. I have no direct connection to soils unfortunately,  I do have a general interest in geoscience ontologies, but my specialty and minimal contribution to ontology has been limited to landform and terrain ontology and design patterns. I joined this group because there are obviously many common ways of thinking and organizing information about natural phenomena that I am sure will be beneficial in my group’s research on landform ontology. There is an obvious connection between landform/landscape ontology and soil ontology, and I would also like to ensure we are ultimately able to support soil related concepts in our landform reference ontology that we are developing (very slowly).

Mark Schildhauer, Brandon Whitehead, and David Smith lead discussion:  Semantics Use Case for "Soil Bulk Density"

1) Review bulk density methods and what folks look for in search terms when using datasets/databases  
2) Look for commonalities and think about how to describe in an ontology

Title: Use Case: Semantic Models of Soil Bulk Density \- Wherefore and How?\!  
Presenters: Mark Schildhauer, David Smith, Brandon Whitehead  
Abstract:

Notes

* Rationale for a semantic approach  
  * Make it so that humans and machines can effectively work with the data  
  * There is a lot of soil data out there  
    * Independent researchers and larger groups  
  * A lot of times you need more data than can be provided by your favorite data resources  
    * You are normally comfortable with finding, accessing, using this  
    * Challenges to using new data  
      * Distributed across the internet  
      * Web exposure and User interfaces vary  
      * Heterogenous formats and schemas  
      * Open the data and there is idiosyncratic naming and methods  
    * Would be great to know what to expect from the data and be able to tell common queries such as regions and dates  
* Why Soil Bulk Density?  
  * Researchers frequently look for data with particular soil measurements  
  * We all agreed that soil bulk density is an important measurement  
* Review bulk density methods  
  * This section is a foundational summary of bulk density data that can lead to future discussions  
  * There are authoritative sources on standards, procedures, and databases  
    * USDA, NRCS, UN FAO, ISRIC, CSIRO, EU JRC (only a partial list)  
      * David has compiled a document of these sources that are on the google drive that summarize them  
    * Each with varying subsequent descriptions about the soil water state and fine earth fraction vs whole soil  
  * Also on the google drive is a matrix of laboratory methods for the sources with cross referencing comparisons  
    * When we go to a database we have to distinguish what type of measurement is being made  
    *  Question: Are the bulk density methods inter-related in the NRCS manual?  
      * It is listed out hierarchically and very well organized, talks about considerations for procedures   
  * Bulk Density is both simple and complex to think about and organize  
    * Density \= mass per unit volume  
    * Soil bulk density \= the ratio of the mass of solids to the total or bulk volume  
      * It is a function, not a single value  
    * However, it is measured with different methods and under varying conditions  
      * How to arrange this and account for it  
* Finding commonalities  
  * Hierarchy of concepts  
    * Properties (concepts)  
      * Soil properties (1 of 35 sub-concepts)  
        * Soil chemicophysical properties (1 of 12 sub-concepts)  
          * Soil density (1 of 18 sub-concepts)  
  * ^ have to think of a framework similar to this   
* Building and using a soil ontology  
  * How to enhance soil data for reuse?  
    * Make them FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)  
      * This is difficult because the data is distributed, heterogenous, of high volume, and of lexical ambiguity  
        * Lexical ambiguity:  
          * “Just” strings  
          * Synonyms  
          * Homonyms  
          * Hierarchy  
          * Relationships  
  * Semantic low hanging fruit  
    * Synonymy: Db (USDA) \= BD (Au) \= soil bulk density  
    * Homonymy: Soil (sensu Earth) \<\> Soil (sensu lunar)  
    * Ontologies can disambiguate terms and make them interpretable by machines and humans as well  
  * ENVO, environment ontology   
    * Each term has a permanent, dereferenceable ID  
      * Also has a definition, a cross-reference for where the definition is from, and terms that are related to it  
  * Semantics for FAIR’er soil data (FAIR & machine actionable)  
    * Findable: Use web-based, persistent identifiers  
    * Accessible: Open protocols  
    * Interoperable: Open community standards  
    * Re-usable: Open knowledge representations   
  * Ecosystems ontology, ECSO  
    * Uses protoge   
      * HTTP URI dereferences to a term in our ontology  
    * Ontology repositories can provide “standard views” of the defererenced terms  
    * There is a soil bulk density in ECSO  
      * Definition, definition source, creator, example of usable, etc.  
  * Semantic Annotation  
    * DataONE’s method for linking data items to terms in an ontology  
      * Raw data in CVS  
      * Metadata describes data sets (ex. using EML)  
      * Optional observational data model separates the entities from their characteristics and links them  
  * Semantic finding and re-using measurements  
    * Annotations currently focused on “attributes” but extendable to other metadata fields  
  * In summary, to make FAIRer  
    * Ontologies  
    * Annotations  
    * Scripts and user interfaces   
  * Semantic web  
    * Use URIs as names for things  
    * Link the URIs  
* Deeper Dive into Ontology Modeling  
  * How might we reuse what is in the databases we have already mentioned in previous meetings?  
    * Earlier we had discussed IRSAD, WoSIS, and SoDaH  
      * Concept mapping tool for definition, type, and data name  
      * WoSIS: Notion of whole soil and fine earth  
        * Used part of relation (fineEarth is a part of wholeSoil)  
        * Comments to explain what each term is  
          * Rdfs:comment allows to put free, unrestricted text  
        * Different types of bulk density and units  
      * SoDaH: trying to fit in with WoSIS  
        * Did not see in metadata, so linked to see where they would fit best  
        * Color coded  
      * ISRaD: fit in with WoSIS and SoDah  
      * What kind of things are useful to the community and what components do we pick apart or reuse?  
      * Link dropped by Simon: [http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/MassDensity](http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/MassDensity)  
* Next Steps  
  * Continue collecting information about soil bulk density methods  
  * Document attribute characteristics and access to databases containing soil bulk density measurements  
  * Start expanding the set of measurements (Ksat? SOC?) to include in Ontology  
  * Start to build out RDF/OWL based ontology  
    * Knowledge modelers would be thinking about design patterns and terms that we could re-use  
    * Contribute to existing Ontologies?  
    * Governance?  
      * Who determines what a good definition is?  
      * Use ESIP as a foundation?  
* Questions:  
  * Comment from Doug Wysocki: For bulk density, the common practice is to measure the mass after oven drying. The volume is generally measured in the field.  
    * KTB would be interested to break this out but a lot of the datasets that she works with do not have this documented and therefore may not be able to format to this  
    * Doug Wysocki: all other measures of soils are all on the 2 mm basis  
    * Mark Schildhauer: If you can express them in the way that you are, you can also model and capture them. It is not straight jacketing you, it is allowing you to express your metadata.  
    * Doug Wysocki: Communicating these and getting the expertise together involves everyone in this  
    * KTB: If we can get annotated, we can develop toolsets  
    * Mark Schildhauer: One of the other advantages with the hierarchical approach is that you do not have to go into excruciating detail but you can if you want.  
      * Can always just go very coarse but can also go fine grain.  
    * KTB: folks have access to databases that can leverage these  
    * Mark Schildhauer: Again the benefit here is not for the daily use of databases that you are familiar with but for when you are expanding your data. You use 80% of your time trying to find and wrangle the data.  
  * Megan Wong: I have challenges deciding how concepts fit to data model \- eg is it a process, an obsv property, a procedure. Those SWEET categories struck me as useful   
    * Simon Cox: disentangling 'observable property' and 'method' is part of the question. SOSA/O\&M provides a way to keep them separate, but common practice is to conflate them. Sampling is a whole other (very important) layer or part of the protocol or procedure (SOSA is an OWL implementation of O\&M with slight refinement)  
    * Mark Schildhauer: When you get to the mid or upper levels of ontology it can get murky. To me, everything is a process but I understand the benefit of describing something as a property. What is that feature of interest/ what is that observable property? A little semantics goes a long way in any case  
  * KTB: I would love to move forward with some sort of ontological understanding to work with the datasets, so what are the next steps:  
    * Mark Schildhauer: I think that we should keep working with Bulk Density. Brandon has done the brute work.  
    * Simon: A scan of the lab methods book in the google drive folder  
      * there is a whole \_chapter\_ on Bulk Density and Pore Space Relations in CSIRO's Brown Book that David already referred to   
    * Dylan Beaudette: Can we send out Andrew's detailed discussion of Db?  
    * KTB: can pull bulk density from some of the data sets too from other folks  
* The Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WATqzxLPXaI2ZB\_V6plO7Jj4I9Xi\_PkF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WATqzxLPXaI2ZB_V6plO7Jj4I9Xi_PkF)

**Recap:** Dr. Megan Wong (Centre for eResearch and Innovation (CeRDI) Federation Uni Australia) presented on the approaches, challenges, and solutions for applying controlled vocabularies in standardizing agricultural soils data in Australia. Balancing the needs of informatics with data providers remains a key challenge; data providers often provide poorly or undocumented data requiring constant communication between the informatics team and data providers. Manual templates filled out by the informatics team remains a critical step in data integration for the project. While control vocabulary and procedures from larger groups (INSPIRE and the Green/Yellow books) were leveraged in the group when possible, it was still necessary to create new presuctures and vocabularies to capture the data.

**Presentation Title:** Our approach, challenges of and solutions for applying controlled vocabularies for the standardisation of soils data. Use cases: Farming Systems Groups and Catchment Management Authorities in Australia, The Centre for eResearch and Digital Innovation (CeRDI), Federation University Australia 

**Presenter**: Dr Megan Wong, on behalf of CeRDI team working with soil data: Assoc Prof Peter Dalhaus, Bruce Simons, Andrew MacLeod, Heath Gillett, Dr Nathan Robinson, Dr Angela Neyland, Derek Walters  
   
**Abstract:** The Centre for eResearch and Digital Innovation (CeRDI), Federation University Australia, are soil data brokers for a number of data providers and users, principally for Farming Systems Groups and Catchment Management Authorities. Some of the projects/initiatives being delivered under at present include Visualising Australasia’s Soils (Soil CRC), Corangamite and Glenelg Hopkins CMA Soil Heath Knowledge Bases, and the Agricultural Research Federation (AgReFed). We are users of controlled vocabularies, and where necessary we create and manage them. The application of controlled vocabularies helps to meet data provider/user use cases including: Search and discovery through a shared data platform; Communication, context and trust; and Interface functionality for data management. We receive data in mostly as excel format and database dumps, in unstructured formats, and not always well described. Whilst data providers use some standard Australian National methods, for example in soil chemistry, machine readable controlled vocabularies have needed to be created for these. We describe the types of vocabularies we have applied, to general observations and measurements design patterns, for the description of the soil data we deliver. We cover some of the challenges encountered in discovering, applying and creating controlled vocabularies, and our current solutions. This may provide some useful insights for the development of a Soil Ontology by this group.

**Notes:**

1. Vocabularies are used to describe observations, measurements made on specimens and features, and feature relationships  
   1. Link the different terms using relationships  
2. Visualizing Autralasia’s soils interface  
   1. When you click on the samples you can see their properties, unit of measure, procedure used, and control vocabulary  
   2. Challenges: balance the need of what the users would want with the scientists  
      1. Compromise required, need to consider soil information/O\&M perceptive  
      2. What is scientifically correct?  
3. INSPIRE terms for feature type vocabularies, RO ontologies for relationship and type vocabularies  
   1. Some challenges interpreting/selecting, and then applying the terms consistently  
4. Vocabulary selection  
   1. Judgement calls   
   2. Preferably has a definition that matches what you want  
   3. Correct context based on hierarchy that it fits into   
      1. Makes sense within it  
   4. Are reused in other ontologies  
      1. Could indicate that it is reputable and might help link them all one day into a larger web  
   5. Human readable and machine readable  
5. How do we know if we really need to create a new vocabulary  
   1. Quick service approach  
6. Challenges  
   1. Does it need to say “in soil”  
   2. Do units matter or can we still use the vocabulary even if our units do not match  
   3. Is it an observed property? What can I use to describe this?  
7. Various ontologies have soil processes relating to the living soil  
   1. *From Simon Cox* \-- Recommend also loooking at this catalogue of 'QuantityKind' [http://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC\_VOCAB-QUANTITY-KINDS.html](http://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC_VOCAB-QUANTITY-KINDS.html) for the basic observable properties \- no chemistry, just the basics, to which you would need to add the substance and matrix   
   2. *From Simon Cox* \-- These all have RDF representations, and dimension-vectors, and associated units-of-measure here [http://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC\_VOCAB-UNITS.html](http://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC_VOCAB-UNITS.html)   
   3. PATO, MICRO, etc.  
8. Challenges of describing which vocabs to use  
   1. Go abstract to reduce the number of observed properties?  
   2. It is somewhat unclear what an observed property is  
   3. What is most useful? Who will find it useful?  
   4. *From Simon Cox* \-- If your favorite unit or QK is missing, request it here [https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/issues](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/issues)  
      1. [https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/wiki/QuantityKind-Vocabulary-Submission-Guidelines](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/wiki/QuantityKind-Vocabulary-Submission-Guidelines)  
      2. [http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/AmountOfSubstanceConcentrationOfB](http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/AmountOfSubstanceConcentrationOfB)  or [http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/MassConcentration](http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/MassConcentration)   
   5. *From Mark*: mass concentrations could be an observable property for the example given  
      1. At what level to describe the vocabularies?  
9.  Example of soil phosphorus results from soil biological lab  
   1. What soil P process is being measured? What compound/form? Degree of resolution/accuracy?  
10. Current approach and considerations: Controlled vocabulary creation  
    1. Create concepts that do not exist elsewhere such as asserted values (classifiers) and soil chemical procedure vocabs  
    2. *From Mark Schildhauer* \-- QUDT would tell us about a generic type of quantity: mass-concentration; while OC/OM would tell us about the "semantic type" of that mass concentration  
       1. offhand, e.g. OC would be a subclass of OM  
       2. in an ontology, you'd model "OC" part\_of "Total C"  
    3. Considerations  
       1. Upskilling, time and effort  
       2. Domain expertise needed  
       3. URIs unique  
11. Unit of measure  
    1. Try to map to units as provided  
       1. If it is not provided (real pain and time consuming) try to contact the provider  
    2. Never create their own UoM vocabularies  
    3. Github is the primary maintenance environment  
       1. Some units added as pull-requests  
       2. *From Simon Cox* \-- [https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/issues/250](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/issues/250)   
          1. Open source \- [https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/tree/master/schema](https://github.com/qudt/qudt-public-repo/tree/master/schema)

          4. Note that all these codes (6G1 etc) are directly from the book [https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/6418](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/6418)   
             1. ^^Work in progress  
12. In Australia most of the biogeochemical methods come from the green book (Soil Chemical Methods \- Australia). Handbook codes come from yellow book (Australian SOil and Land Survey Field Handbook)  
13. Soil chemical procedures is a nightmare  
    1. Different types of classification schemes for what are essentially the same attributes  
    2. Clarified with the provider but this is not always possible with historic data  
    3. More than one green book code is occasionally provided  
    4. Have not linked methods yet, for example 7C1 and 7C2  
       1. Sometimes have to do a very generic code  
    5. Sometimes there are underlying procedure with additional calculations that make it difficult to know what to capture  
14. Books:   
    1. The yellow book \--  has multiple chapters, and we are coding them one at a time. We will have just about finished it when a new edition will be coming out, so we will have to go into a revision of the online vocabulary straight away  
       1. *Andrew Biggs* supervising this revision  
    2. The green book \-- (what Megan is working on) [https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/EIS/repos/australian-soil-vocabularies/browse/scma/SCMA.ttl](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/EIS/repos/australian-soil-vocabularies/browse/scma/SCMA.ttl)  
    3. *From Simon Cox* \-- It is worth pointing out that when coding the Yellow and Green books we have taken them 'as is' and have deliberately \_not\_ done any remediation during coding, because we did not want to confuse the two processes in the workflow.  
15. Problem \-- using 2 different schemas for the same attribute  
16. Data standardization: interoperability, not reinventing wheels  
17. AGRO (Agronomy Ontology) \- Contains farming/agricultural vocabulary  
18. The starting assumption is that the handbooks are well thought through  
    1. Lift out what is in them to fit into a network/ontology  
19. You can count on one hand the number of soil laboratories in australia  
    1. Can solve this problem if every lab formatted data consistently  
       1. Hence why the green and yellow books exists  
       2. This is however sadly not what happens  
    2. Australia would be a good place to start  
       1. Real target audience is the laboratories

For those who were unable to, here is a recap:

1. We are officially an ESIP cluster\! Upcoming changes to watch for include a new mailing list (no action required on your part), a switch from Zoom to GoToMeeting (link forthcoming), a new ESIP wiki page, and a channel on the ESIP Slack for our cluster. We will make a broader announcement once the ESIP wiki page and other logistical details are finalized; stay tuned\!  
2. We discussed shifting the time of the meetings to better accommodate the US Pacific coast. We will now switch between 1600/2300 UTC (instead of 1400/2300 UTC).    
3. We organized future presentations (we are always looking for presentation volunteers so please reach out if you have an interest in sharing with the cluster\!). Mark Schildhauer will lead a discussion on bulk density on December 2nd and we’ll be reaching out to folks for the November 18th meeting.

### Action Item:

Bulk density protocols and notes here: [Bulk Density Ref](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WATqzxLPXaI2ZB_V6plO7Jj4I9Xi_PkF?usp=sharing)  
1\) If you are a field soil scientist, what is your decision tree for taking  a bulk density measurement? 

- Tnwilliamson:  if need information about porosity and soil structure

2\) If you are soil data user, how do you identify ‘usable’ bulk density data in a database/dataset?

- Tnwilliamson:  either it comes from national lab or I know the person who / method to collected / analyzed the sample 

### 

### **Chat log:** [20201021\_ontology\_meeting\_saved\_chat.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BPzZgfvQ8LcGjY-cYaw_W_rVruuy5mR/view?usp=sharing) 

**Agenda:**

1) Review survey of current soil data products  
   1) [https://github.com/ESIPFed/soil\_data\_model\_survey](https://github.com/ESIPFed/soil_data_model_survey) (see data/ for metadata tables)  
2) Layout soil ontology game plan/tasks  
   1) Revisit/restructure data model descriptions  
   2) Extend repository to include major databases/data-models (NRCS-NASIS, FAO-GSP-GLOSIS, and others)  
3) Notes  
   1) Maybe confirmed as an ESIP cluster?? TBD  
   2) Comment from AB(?)  
      1) Different data collected differently  
      2) Two specific TYPES of datasets (research, and general soil surveys) noted in paper that are together, though in Australia they keep those separate  
      3) How to keep them separate in database, like like putting square in circle  
      4) Exchange between two is critical  
      5) How are data collected?  
      6) Researchers don’t use national coded dictionaries, though they exist (i.e. Australia)  
      7) Problem is how to get people to do that, maybe a cultural challenge, “is it beneficial to me?” mindset,  
      8) [http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/soil/au/scma](http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/soil/au/scma)  
         1) ^^Are updated item by item.  
      9) Two things  
         1) Take historical data and work with it  
         2) Create process and system to make it easier for researchers going forward  
   3) David \- are there any other industries that could be interested in standardizing their data  
      1) Question \- with university cooperators, is it the case, that people are using NRCS characterization, NASIS data structure?  
      2) Tanja \- data might be more difficult to bring in  
      3)   
   4) Kathe \- in touch with Pecan Street, a private sector organization  
      1) How to incorporate qualities that are less common/more rare?  
   5) Tanja \- would land grant universities be interested  
      1) Another source \- \_\_\_ with elemental data  
      2) Start with cross referencing? Surveys and ontologies  
         1) Could unlock vast new data/research  
   6) [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/tools/?cid=nrcs142p2\_053547](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/tools/?cid=nrcs142p2_053547)   
      1) ^^NASIS 7 metadata  
   7) Simon  
      1) I understand that SCMA is/was used quite broadly by the Australian state agencies, but Andrew and Nathan would be in a better position to comment. We have a goal of getting all the NCST handbooks ported to the online registry, partly because they will be easier to maintain there  
      2) The O\&M or SOSA model separates 'observed-property' (e.g. bulk density) from 'procedure' (i.e. the reusable method or protocol) from 'sensor' or 'observer' (the instrument or person who implements the procedure). That way you don't have to proliferate the \# of observable-properties too much, while still being able to distinguish different ways of measuring it  
      3)   
   8) It’s taking a lot of time transforming the historical data into newer templates  
   9) NRCS/NCSS laboratory data analytes and code for processing LIMS (internal laboratory database) snapshot- [https://github.com/dylanbeaudette/process-kssl-snapshot/blob/master/NCSS\_Analyte.txt](https://github.com/dylanbeaudette/process-kssl-snapshot/blob/master/NCSS_Analyte.txt)  
   10) Soil Survey Laboratory Methods  (by method code)  
       1) [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE\_DOCUMENTS/nrcseprd1026807.pdf](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcseprd1026807.pdf)  
   11) Suggestion \- start with “bulk density”  
       1) Start with general search and gather the sub-categories  
          1) Superclass is vague enough but useful  
          2) Subclass is more specific and precise  
       2) *Or is it the method of the definition rather than the concept definition?*  
       3) Or searching ontologies for relevant terms, examining them for \_\_\_ (i.e. sieve and \_\_\_)  
       4) Or start with PSD \- leverage all existing transfer functions and comparisons globally by Nemes, McBratney and Minasny, etc (Nathan)  
   12) Nathan \- Yeah \- the exact procedure is often what is missing and critical re data quality and uncertainty in the observation  
   13) Product of interest as a result of survey \- \_\_\_ of \[something\] for soil science community  
   14) Simon Cox suggests use of SOSA/O\&M to cut down on proliferation of observable properties.  
   15) Mark \- O\&M, SOSA, and OBOE (which my group developed) all have a facet to describe “protocol” or “method”.  Whether we then mint a named subclass or not is worth considering. The above are “ontology design patterns” for observations/measurements  
   16) What to include \- based on historical data?  
       1) Statistics  
       2) \_\_\_  
   17) Should devise coding system to capture all the vague terms  
   18) Megan \- collection(s) of terms  
   19) Kathe \- core level terms can still be relevant and useful; different usages may entail needing different levels of detail…  
4) Next steps  
   1) Document what it is researchers need to collect as metadata for their research methods?  
   2) Pick one property of “bulk density” or “\_\_\_\_”, to see how much comparison there is in this small experiment  
   3) Also how we should document how we were able to find how “Bulk Density” is defined in any Database (e.g. having to search some Web site), and then which “variable” in the dataset carries those measurements… it is documenting the difficulty of discovery and access…  
      1) (comment from Mark)  
5) **Drive folder**: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WATqzxLPXaI2ZB\_V6plO7Jj4I9Xi\_PkF?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WATqzxLPXaI2ZB_V6plO7Jj4I9Xi_PkF?usp=sharing)

6) Other version of notes:  
   1) Still waiting to hear back for EISP on the clustering status  
      1) Approved? But still waiting for it to be set up  
      2) Will transition over when that comes through  
         1) Slack channel  
   2) Document touches on two core problems  
      1) Nature of the collection of soil data: soil survey and research  
         1) Soil survey is predominant  
            1) Data that characterizes the natural environment data  
         2) Research data focuses on more specific things  
            1) In Australia, they are kept separate  
         3) Difficulty trying to stick them in one spot because they are fundamentally different   
            1) Sometimes have to accept that we cannot put them all in one spot  
            2) The ability to workout what you can and cannot equate and exchange between them  
      2) Getting to the bottom of how the data was collected  
         1) In Australia there are a bunch of public method codes in a handout (cultural challenge)  
            1) Researchers do not use this  
               1) Convincing them to use it is a common problem  
                  1. A lot are already published  
                  2. Do not want to go back to do it  
         2) Any pipeline where you are asking the data provider to identify their methods with a certain code is basically a no go   
   3) Sharing of data  
      1) LTER is an example of showing the benefit of sharing data  
      2) Sharing data seems to be increasing  
   4) Other problems  
      1) How to flag data quality  
      2) Tertiary datasets  
         1) Duplicate sources of truth (replicates)  
            1) Leads to confusion in the marketplace  
            2) Appropriate metadata could help solve this  
            3) Growing issue at the moment  
   5) AG industry interest that may not be represented here  
      1) Dr. TB is in touch with a group out of pecan street  
      2) Could be interesting to include the perspectives ALTR, the university ag extension university  
   6) Next steps discussion  
      1) Are people using the NRSC data structure?  
         1) Land grant universities are, but non-land grant universities are less likely to  
            1) Data from non-land grant universities would be more difficult to pull in even though they are valuable  
      2) The datasets that Dr. TB works with are less standardized and expensive to run, worth diving into the literature and extracting data  
         1) How can we incorporate rarer descriptions?  
      3) If we could put the traditional data together we could answer some global questions  
         1) No shortage of data out there, just need to get it to a harmonized standard  
            1) Someone has to wade through the data  
   7) Two options for moving forward  
      1) Gather and collect historical data  
      2) Create the processes and systems to make it easier going forwards  
   8) How to start:  
      1) There is already low hanging fruit for us to capture into an ontology   
         1) pH, CEC, bulk density, etc.  
         2) Easier to start with this  
      2) Do we start with cross referencing the largest surveys?  
         1) Seem to agree yes  
      3) Start with bulk density?  
         1) Pull NRSC, ISRIC, Queensland, FAO definitions  
         2) bulk density is appealing because it really gets at the modifiable volumetric unit problem of soils \--it affects all other determinations whether you like it or not  
            1) Diving into one thing like bulk density can drive you down a rabbit hole  
      4) Another way forward is searching ontologies for relevant terms  
         1) Enhancing them and working from there  
      5) Alternate approach  
         1) Taking two data products and try to map them  
            1) More tangible and recordable  
         2) Then add another and see what needs to be added  
         3) More of an applied use case approach and prep the questions  
      6) Coming up with a robust data template could be a product of interest  
   9) Ways to structure it  
      1) The O\&M or SOSA model separates 'observed-property' (e.g. bulk density) from 'procedure' (i.e. the reusable method or protocol) from 'sensor' or 'observer' (the instrument or person who implements the procedure). That way you don't have to proliferate the \# of observable-properties too much, while still being able to distinguish different ways of measuring it  
         1) the exact procedure is often what is missing and critical to data quality and uncertainty in the observation  
      2) subclassing things  
         1) Hierarchy  
   10) A balance of including coarser descriptions  
       1) Knowledge graph become really appealing   
          1) Can lead to the development of questions to drive the focus  
   11) Next steps:  
       1) Documenting what it is that researchers need to collect as metadata for their methods  
          1) Dr. TB disagrees: What is necessary for one use case may not be valuable for others  
             1) Hesitant to tell people that their data is not valuable  
       2) **Come with bulk density methods that we have most frequently used as a start for next meeting**  
          1) Allows us to figure out what is included in the lineup  
          2) Setting up google drive folder

  * R codes available for transforming, harmonizing, and stitching  
  * Their metadata template is inspired by ISCN via ISRAD  
    * Presently all data is manually entered  
    * Fewer tabs: 1\) location 2\) metadata  
  * Other challenges  
    * How data is collected and how you record that against others  
    * Maintaining data hierarchy  
    * How to align data when sometimes you have the needed data from a site but from the wrong plots on the sites  
    * Site characteristics  
    * Chemical, physical, topographical properties of sites vary  
    * Manipulation and time series  
    * Data analysis \- alignment and aggregate  
  * Data synthesis challenges  
    * Mapping “bottlenecking”  
      * Maintaining parent-child relationships  
      * map ping from EML metadata to harmonize data products  
      * Controlled vocabulary, dictionary  
  * *Comment from an attendee*: SoDaH laid out a great foundation for the soil/carbon world regarding ontologies.  
  * This work calls for control vocabulary/dictionary and coordinating amongst networks  
  * I note that LTER includes a controlled vocabulary of:

| carbon dynamics, carbon, organic carbon, soil, soil bulk density, soil carbon, soil chemistry, soil horizons, soil moisture, soil nitrogen, soil nutrients, soil organic matter, soil ph, soil phosphorus, soil properties, soil respiration, soil samples, soil solution chemistry, soil texture |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| And LTER core areas | Movement of Organic Matter, Movement of Inorganic Matter |

  *   
* 2nd speaker \- Chair Kathe Todd-Brown \- ISCN background  
  * Built off of ?Kellog soil science lab?  
  * Started with ISCN, idea was to bring soil carbon researchers together around data  
  * ISCN pre-2017 workflow  
    * Largest profile collection in the world in 2015  
    * Data provider fills out a template  
    * Data coordinator iterates w providers  
    *  Template is passed to database admin and merged  
      * Closed-box product difficult to build off of after generational turnover  
    *  Database is QA/QC’d and published  
  * Challenges that arose  
    * Self-reference columns vs metadata  
      * For example, units were encapsulated in the column name vs in a separate column  
    * Mismatched methods  
      *   Sieved vs hand-picked bulk density, not directly comparable methods  
    * Provenance, i.e. missing decimal points  
      * · Cannot change if not your data, how do you track and maintain

      QA/QC, i.e. repeated data

  * Creation of 4 sheets with undergraduate lab students  
    * *Data structure* describes tables and elements

## Recap

	We brushed up the purpose statement, brain stormed some community presentations we would like to see happen and started to talk about collaboration session topics.   
   
Instead of recapping this directly here I would like to encourage you to head over to this google form: [https://forms.gle/etCvs633dEyBZHWTA](https://forms.gle/etCvs633dEyBZHWTA) to vote on some priorities for the group. There are 5 sections here: a group name, ratification of the group purpose statement, topics for the community presentations, topics for collaborative sessions, and finally some brief questions about who you are and the level of engagement you are looking for with the group. The collaboration sessions are relatively ambiguous at this stage, think of this as a broad gauge at this stage and we’ll resurvey after the first two community presentations.

## Agenda

1. New? Add your introduction to the end of this document\!  
2. Vision and purpose document [SoilOnt-Purpose | Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fx4B1oLamhacp-bujAL2UrKaTBcSe_gGocaOUYJ_zpA/edit?usp=sharing) **\[Breakout group discussions \- 5 minutes\]**  
   1. GOAL: Is there anything that absolutely *MUST* change?   
      1. Minor suggestions or revisions for this document can go to Kathe or dropped into the comments.  
   2. BY FRIDAY: We’ll vote to ‘ratify’ the vision/purpose document after this meeting via google survey. All future group activities must align with this vision/purpose document. Vision/purpose will be revisited next summer.  
   3. GOAL: Generate name ideas\! Vote at the end of the meeting on August 26th  
      1. SILT \[Soil Information Linkage Team \*or similar HT Jessica B\]  
      2. SOIL \[Soil Ontology and Information Lineup\]   
      3. SOW \[Soil Ontology Working group\]  
      4. Soil Ontology working group \[acronyms are over used\]  
      5. SoilInfo \[too cool for acronyms but cool enough to drop syllables\]  
3. Planning for community presentations **\[Breakout group discussions \- 10 minutes\]**  
   1. Goal: 3 months of topics/orgs list (with presenters)  
   2. Goal: List of questions we are interested in community speaking to  
4. Planning for working group **\[Breakout group discussions \- 10 minutes\]**  
   1. Goal: Identify top 3 measurements we want to translate to ontologies,   
      1. Include nominations for a lab person to give a brief (5-10) measurement background and an ontology specialist who will commit to showing up at that meeting.

## Notes

### Community presentations brainstorm

#### Who we want speaking

* Groups and specific individuals therein who have developed and/or are developing soil vocabularies or ontologies in the past  
  * E.g. US NRCS National soil information system, soil characterization data, Ecological site descriptions  
  * Australian soil taxonomy vocabulary services  
  * [European INSPIRE soil theme](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme/so)  
* Soil data generators who use soil vocabularies/ontologies  
* Machine learning developers who use ontologies (?soil)  
* Informatics people who can explain workflow, tools (Pier\!), (Wade Bishop)  
* Need to include soil researchers, data repository managers, knowledge modellers, and database modellers  
* Experts in methodological harmonization (how to translate across different techniques for measuring, e.g. pH, bulk density, etc.)  
* Researchers currently working on some soil synthesis/integration project to tell us of their challenges (finding data?  interpreting/re-using data? re-shaping/converting data?)  
* Need to consider dealing with legacy data vs “looking ahead”  
* People translating conceptual models into implementations of data models  
* Spatial data (map) vs point data (pedon)-- how scale these  
* Users of soil synthesis productions (Modelers, policy, farmers, etc)

#### Question to presenters: 

* How do you manage or connect soil/scientific information?  
* What is difficult about what you do?  
* What works really well?  
* How can we train future professionals in these areas?  
* Can you walk us through an example or short case study that highlights the work you do (tools, workflow, inputs, outputs?)

#### Possible organizations

* [Global Soil Partnership](http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/en/), [Global Soil Information System](https://glosis.isric.org/)   
* USDA, NRCS \- Dylan Beaudette??, Dough?

* ENVO \- Pier Luigi Buttigieg  
* CSIRO Australia  
* International Soil Carbon Network \- Kathe Todd-Brown and SoDaH \- Will Wieder/Stevan Earl \[keyed template approach to harmonization\]  
* Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research (New Zealand)? Vocabularies: Brandon Whitehead?  
* Kathi Schleidt \- how to implement conceptual models (eg INSPIRE) using the latest geostandards (OpenAPI, Sensorthings etc) and then what challenges do you face  
* Nic Jelinski \- University of Minnesota \- linking public & private soil datasets (example of soil organic carbon / permafrost affected soils in Alaska, USA).  

### Working group actions

#### Brainstorm

* Construct ontologies for common soil measurements taken from survey of research data products and extant vocabularies  
  * Start by building concept maps, use those maps to help us identify good starting points for building the ontological terms  
* UI to construct data template from common vocabularies  
  * Make synonyms list?  
    * What tools already exist  
    * Is this properties? Or methods? Or taxonomy?  
* Publicize resource list for soil informatics  
* Review ENVO soil terminology  
* Applications of ontology design patterns for soil description  
* Tools and guidelines for how to map your data to ontologies (Hale Studio?)  
* Mechanisms to automate annotation/alignment of legacy data to “modern” vocabularies  
* Governance?

## Post meeting Recap

August 12th’s meeting had 18+ participants. The focus of this meeting was to identify what we, as participants, wanted to get out of these meetings. There were three general themes to the responses: connect with other researchers, review existing resources, and develop targeted ontology/resources/tools to help the soil informatics community. A lot of discussion went into aggregating and reviewing existing resources, rightly so since there seems to be a lot out there\! 

Here is a link to a working draft of the group purpose and vision: [SoilOnt-Purpose | Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fx4B1oLamhacp-bujAL2UrKaTBcSe_gGocaOUYJ_zpA/edit?usp=sharing) I’m proposing that we split our meeting times between presentations and working groups. Keep an eye out for further discussion\!

## Agenda

* Recap of previous meeting  
* Introductions and what do you want to get out of this group? \[Breakout groups \- 5 minutes \=\> group check ins\]  
* What is the “Mission statement” of this group? \[Breakout groups \- 10 minutes \=\> group check ins\]

## Homework

* What do YOU want to get out of this group?  
  * Information gathering:   
    * Contact groups working on soil ontologies/vocabularies and ask for seminars/QA sessions  
    * Learning from each other in general, different soil subfields  
  * Ontology development:   
    * Submit/curate ontology submissions (ENVO?)  
    * Connecting vocabularies/ontologies  
  * Better connections/understanding of data needs and data management challenges for different soil subfields  
  * Lower barrier to entry for using updated base data for research; updating measurement linkages; tracing data usage to decisions  
  * Make data more FAIR  
* What resources are you aware of around soil ontologies and vocabularies?

## Mission Statements from second breakouts:

Participants:  Jennifer, Brandon, Mark, Gary

Breakout \#1:  assess existing best-of-class “soil vocabulary/thesaurus” resources, and then identify (extend, reformat?) and/or develop a community-vetted Soil Ontology for use by agency, academic and policy researchers to make data, or any research artifact, more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) if it has a soil aspect.  Will require identifying useful knowledge modeling “structures”: web-accessible dereferenceable HTTP IRI identifiers for terms, associated labels and definitions, subsumption, properties, possible further axiomatization useful for classification and inferencing-- granule size, carbon content, mineral composition, etc.) Start with identifying core set of 2-3 dozen useful terms (relatable to real data), spanning the most important aspects of soil, and highly relevant to current critical foci of soil research and data description. Consider how these can be integrated into existing ontology(ies) such as SWEET or EnvO? Focus on Data relevant\! But bonus points for including terms that can also be used in statements about relationships: “some” soilType “facilitates” “some” “crop”-- a statement that would be more a model outcome or result, but well-defined due to referencing terms from the Soil Ontology

\#4: Recognizing the existence and diversity among soil terms and vocabularies, lots of value already on the shelf. View this as incremental process and training material is really valuable. What would incremental deliverables look like? Cryosymatic group focus on one-two terms per call. As we are creating this keep an eye on text mining and machine learning.  
	From Pier Luigi Buttigieg (Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration) to Everyone: (7:47 PM)  

Here's an example of a cryohackothon session:   
https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/784

\#3: lots of existing terminology and we are NOT interested in creating a new vocabulary but are interested in bridging vocabularies. Maybe not harmonizing but comparing definitions.  Pick some small property domain (ideally related to a specific problem/use case) and compare terminology across several widely used vocabularies, mapping level might start with just linking to all definitions related to a particular term; better yet add annotation to indicate how similar/dissimilar the labeled concepts are in the different vocabularies. 

\#2: Work on some kind of case study or ‘competency questions’ ontology design patterns (??). Example case of ‘how we do ontology’.  Linking in vocabulary with what ends up being quantitative differences

## Post-call recap 

This kick off call started with a round of introductions. Many of us recognized each other from ESIP or previous ontology collaborations but there were some welcome new faces. We then moved to breakout rooms to identify what exactly our understanding of an ontology was and recapped with a group discussion. Some common themes that came up was the idea of an ontology as a structured vocabulary where terms were formally interrelated to each other using an axiomatic structure. PLB then walked through a graphical example of this (see notes). Three key takeaways from this discussion include: 1\) Due to the formal relationships between different vocabularies, it’s possible to infer properties not directly declared. 2\) Ontologies tend to shy away from thresholds and talk more about relationships between vocabularies. 3\) Meetings will be every other week with rotating times to accommodate Europe and Australia.  
	Next call will focus on identifying a mission/vision for the group so we can start mapping out action plans.

(July 30\) 1AM Australian Eastern \- (July 29\) 8AM US Pacific \- 11AM US Eastern – 5PM Central Europe \- 3pm UTC

   * Kathe Todd-Brown: I’m a computational biogeochemist who is interested in large datasets to support soil carbon model development. I’m a professor at the University of Florida and the data coordinator for the International Soil Carbon Network. My interest in this group is to develop formal registered language that I can use to help harmonize data from different sources. (KTB)  
   * Pier Luigi Buttigieg: I’m an ontologist with a life science background interested in helping expert groups encode their knowledge in community reference ontologies to help global harmonisation in the digital space. More [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088).  
   * Stevan Earl: I am the information manager for the CAP LTER and Global Institute of Sustainability \- both at Arizona State University. I have been working with an LTER Synthesis Group focused on soil organic matter dynamics, and see ontological approaches/resources as critical to such synthetic efforts.  
   * Brain Wee: I am cross-trained in computer science, ecology, and policy, and generally work at the intersection of all three areas.  Obsessed with terms and definitions, mostly because of policy (legal) implications.  Co-chair of the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Agriculture and Climate Cluster.

   * Jessica Burnett: Research ecologist and postdoc at USGS. I am generally interested in improving the utility and usefulness of ecological data and have recently taken interest in how ontologies (formally or more loosely) and gdbs \[formally, or more loosely (as concept maps…?)\] can achieve this.  
   * Hava Blair: PhD student at University of Minnesota, Land & Atmospheric Sciences program.  My research is in linking soil properties and processes with agricultural management practices (“soil health”).  We are curating and harmonizing regional soil health datasets as part of a soil health database project in partnership with agroinformatics platform [GEMS](https://agroinformatics.org/).  Starting to learn about the value of ontologies for linking data and eager to learn/help develop more soil-specific ontology terms.

Part of the original cryo vocabulary/glacier domain work to harmonize term definitions and EnvO.    
   * 

2. ## What is an ontology? \[5 minute breakout groups \- time up at 32 minutes past the hour\]

   * An ontology is a machine-readable, graph-based representation of knowledge built around a terminology, which uses formal logic to capture relationships between entities. structured control vocabulary to support data annotation (PLB).  
   * An ontology is a structured control vocabulary to support data annotation. (KTB)  
   * A vocabulary with definitions behind the terms, with a hierarchy or structure to relate them to each other (TNW)  
   * A formal (controlled vetted) representation of knowledge in some domain that is intended for machine use (BT)   
   * "An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization." (Studer et al, 1998; Guarino et al, 2009).  OR in other words... A precise presentation of a view of some selected part of the world, representing the entities and the relationships between them that are of interest for some particular purpose.  In informatics, 'precise presentation' has the connotation that the representation is machine-readable and follows some formal logic.   
   * Knowledge organization that is axiomatized (i.e. axioms \[rules\] associated with machine-readable / machine-parsable concepts.. And algorithms can use those axioms to reason through the represented knowledge) (SC)  
   * Ontologies are the product of systematic study and ordering of the *categories* for and relationship of things that exist or may exist in some domain of interest ***D***. They are expressed in some language **L** which may be formal for computational processing of formal *axioms* and they also include a vocabulary **V** to express definitions and relations. This form is readily understandable and discussable by humans in a suitable language **V1**. (GBC)  
   * Pier’s real-time example of an ontology represented as a graph (dashed edge vector is an example of something a machine can “infer” logic is defined clearly)  
   * :![][image1]  
     * Pier: shows hierarchy and also a graph, network object in mathematics, machines can figure out the validity of a statement  
       * Stephen: shows representation of an ontology, but an ontology itself is the term, any kind of knowledge is a network in a sense, so a graph is a way of representing networks of connected nodes, axioms provide rules about relationships that build the logic into the system (what they mean and how they constrain what is possible),   
       * Pier: AI can fill in the gaps based on your specifications  
     * Tanja: Is there a way to use it to look at concentrations and start to see the thresholds we would consider as a problem?  
       * Pier: there are ways to add thresholds into ontologies  
       * Simon: previously used numerical thresholds in geological classifications, but not soils  
       * Stephen: the challenge is how to deal with thresholds in a systematic way  
       * Simon: all of the classifications are continuous and we choose to assign names to a particular area to do with particular proportions  
       * Pier: do not get hung up too much on concentrations, think about the compositions, properties, and qualities first, then you can start to refine, terms/definitions you use are mainly for you and machines focus on links more than anything  
     * Tanja: Can you tie together the US and European systems?  
       * Pier: that would be the hope, opportunity to start coordinating between different systems, not guaranteed that it can tolerate the differences

3. ## What is missing from soil ontologies? \[\[NOT covered in call\]\]

   * Soil taxonomies from multiple systems (KTB)  
   * Consistently precise definitions that separate essential characteristics from occasional or ambiguous features of soil types (PLB)  
   * Annotations that indicate uncertainty, ambiguity, or disagreement over soil definitions across the community (PLB)  
   * Consistently precise definitions that disambiguate measurements derived from different methods (e.g., pH extracted in water versus a salt solution) with implications for interpretation (SRE, HB)  
   * A formal representation (OWL, UML...) (SMR)  
   * Links between vocabularies developed in different communities (esp. internationally) (SJDC)  
   * An agreement on a starter conceptual model that covers the domain or use case of interest and has obvious and useful connection points to extant related ontologies.(GBC)  
   * A good use case with connection to data and a scoped set of terms  to make this useful with a modest effort.(GBC)

4. ## Where do we want to start? \[\[NOT covered in call\]\]

   * Look at the relevant data and its vocabulary and systematize this.(GBC)  
     * Relate this to or use to construct a Use Case.  
   * Describing various bulk density measurements and methods (KTB)  
   * Describing various hydraulic conductivity measurements and estimations  
   * Identifying the soil classification systems used by the various groups involved (PLB)  
     * Finding (example) overlaps and differences to begin harmonising these (PLB)  
   * Approach to describing observations (bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon....) (SMR)  
   * Characterizing the concept spaces for existing classification systems. (SMR)  
   * Definition of properties in the ISCN template.xlsx (SMR)

5. ## “Mission Statement” of the group \[\[pick up for next call\]\]

   * Split into groups to attack parts of the soil semantics universe and start adding them to ontologies such as ENVO, make sure that this bridges the quirks of pedologists, biogeochemists, soil health experts and other soil expertise silos  (HKB) Maybe start with controlled vocabularies to help get a first order of control and prioritise ontology work (JW)  
   * Trying to connect efforts across soils subdisciplines; improve transparency in methods and data (nic and tanja summarised by jlb)  
   * Re-use existing resources (e.g. ENVO/OBO)

6. ## Plan for next meeting

   * Revisit group mission statement  
   * Next meeting is two weeks from now
