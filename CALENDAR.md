# 2026 Calendar

> In 2026 we would like to:
> - move back to a bi weekly frequency after the winter holidays
> - expand the meeting format to include:
>   + Info share: seminar presentations on soil semantics and their applications
>   + Feedback gathering: provide friendly reviews on manuscripts and other materials that cluster members are working on
>   + Networking: mixer-style meetings to encourage conversation and professional connections
>
> *From [Discussion #2](https://github.com/ESIPFed/soil-ontology-informatics-cluster/discussions/2) and updated [Discussion #3](https://github.com/ESIPFed/soil-ontology-informatics-cluster/discussions/3)*
