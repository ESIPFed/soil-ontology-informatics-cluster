# 2026 Calendar

> In 2026 we would like to:

> - expand the meeting format to include:
>   + seminar presentations on soil semantics and their applications
>   + provide friendly reviews on manuscripts and other materials that cluster members are working on
>   + mixer-style meetings to encourage conversation and professional connections
>
